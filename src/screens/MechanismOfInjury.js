              Mechanism of Injury (MOI)
              The immediate cause of an injury or sudden illness.
              Do not think like a radical at this stage!
              It's not the root cause, but the direct cause.
              MOI determines
              Whether the danger persists
              0 potential harm to you, e.g.
              Â·cops
              traffic
              0 continuing to harm the patient, e.g.
              bums
              ongoing brutality
              vehicle

              Persistent MOI
              The other potential red flag for the MOI stage is a persistent mechanism of injury.
              1. What is the MOI for a burn?
              0  Heat -so that's what we try to address.
              2. How about MOI for an impaled object?
              0 The object -we don't remove these, so we're going need further care.
              Persistent MOI calls for intervention. Ifyou cannot intervene safely or successfully, get help!
